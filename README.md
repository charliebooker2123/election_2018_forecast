Here is my forecast. Democrats win big! Blue Wave!


With the Midterm Elections coming to a hault, I predict that Democrats will overwelmingly take the House. It is a bit of a toss up when it comes to the Senate. It will not be outrageous if Democrats take the Senate as well based upon a possible close win for Beto O'Rourke in Texas and Bill Nelson in Florida, both states in which are notorious Republican states. I'm predicting that the Democrats will win these 2 key states, and that the millenial voting turnout will turn the wave in favor of Democrats.
